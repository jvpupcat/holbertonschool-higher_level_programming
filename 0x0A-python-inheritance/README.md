## Overview of Inheritance

Inheritance is a powerful feature in object-oriented programming. It enables us to define a class that takes all the functionality from parent class and allows us to add more.

Python has two built-in functions that work with inheritance:
```
- isinstance() to check an instance's type: isinstance(obj, int) will be True only if obj.__class__ is int or some class derived from int.

- issubclass() to check class inheritance: issubclass(bool, int) is True since bool is a subclass of int. However, issubclass(float, int) is False since float is not a subclass of int.
```
